## Overview

JukaGUI is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Trimui Smart Pro and Trimui Brick. This project is split into two primary components:

1. **Website with Drag/Drop Interface**: This interface allows users to generate `jukaconfig.json` code effortlessly.
2. **Player Application**: Developed in Go, this player takes the `jukaconfig.json` file and launches the application accordingly.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main files:

- **Index.html**: Utilized for generating the GUI via a drag-and-drop interface.
- **Player**: Executes the `jukaconfig.json` files, effectively running the apps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To set up your development environment, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [SDL2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/)

### Installation

1. **Drag/Drop GUI:**
   - Open `index.html` and modify it to suit your requirements.

2. **Player:**
   - Follow the instructions to install Go.
   - Install SDL2 by following the steps on [go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/).
   - Make necessary changes to the Go code as per your needs.

## Usage

### Creating the GUI

To create the GUI using the drag-and-drop interface:

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
2. Utilize the drag-and-drop elements to design your GUI.
3. Save the configuration, which will be generated in the `jukaconfig.json` file.

### Running the Application

To run the application using the player:

1. Ensure you have the `jukaconfig.json` file ready.
2. Use the Go player to execute the configuration:
   ```sh
   go run player.go
   ```
3. The application should launch as per the configurations defined in the jukaconfig.json file.
